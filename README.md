# AbracadabraDB

Due trademark conflict Abracadabra DB has changed project name.
Someone just registered trademark with typo for same product class.

__Therefore This domain will be abandoned.__

There is new home, new project name - same code - and trademark that covers new place.

## Where is the code?!

If you know what is the 'question' you will find the 'answer'.

Otherwise probably you don't need that tool.
